<h1 id="san-diego-r-users-group">San Diego R Users Group</h1>

<p>I recently started an
  <a href="https://www.meetup.com/sd-r-users/">R user group in San Diego</a>.
We&rsquo;ve only had one meeting so far but plans are in the works for more.
I started this group so San Diego R users can get together, learn from each
  other, and talk about all the great things R has to offer.
R has a fantastic online community and I want to help establish that at a local
  level.</p>

<h1 id="seefood-shiny-app">Seefood Shiny App</h1>

<p>I made a Shiny application based on the
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ACmydtFDTGs">Seefood</a> app from HBO&rsquo;s
  <em>Silicon Valley</em>.
Given an image, it predicts whether the image is a hot dog or &lsquo;not hot dog&rsquo;.
I built a Keras model on Paperspace and wrapped it in a Shiny application.
You can find the app <a href="https://asbates.shinyapps.io/hotdog/">here</a> and
  the modeling code
  <a href="https://github.com/asbates/neural-nets/tree/master/not-hotdog">here</a>.</p>

<h1 id="r-package-geblm">R package geblm</h1>

<p>I have an R package called
  <a href="https://github.com/asbates/geblm">geblm</a> that implements some research of a
  previous professor.
It implements new MCMC algorithms for Bayesian linear and liner mixed models that
  converge geometrically.
It still needs some work (mainly documentation) but unfortunately I just
  haven&rsquo;t had the time.
I did learn a lot, however, like using C++ with Rcpp, writing unit tests, and
  generally how R packages work.</p>

<h1 id="r-workshops-at-sdsu">R Workshops at SDSU</h1>

<p>I did a few workshops for a student organization, the Society of Statisticians
  and Actuaries, when I was a student at SDSU.
I gave workshops on an introduction to R, data wrangling with dplyr, data
  visualization with ggplot2, and an introduction to Git &amp; GitHub.
Materials can be found <a href="https://github.com/asbates/ssa_r_workshops">here</a>.
This was a great experience because it forced me to think hard about what I
  think is important about each topic/tool and why others should care.</p>

<h1 id="adventures-in-bayesian-structural-time-series">Adventures In Bayesian Structural Time Series</h1>

<p>I did a group project for a Bayesian statisics course where we were tasked with
  making video tutorials on a topic of our choosing.
We talked about the theory behind Bayesian structural time series and showed
  how to implement the theory with the
  <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bsts/index.html">bsts</a> package.
We had a ton of fun with this project!
The videos had a DnD/adventure theme where viewers were on quest to learn about
  the topic (we may have went a little overboard with this theme ðŸ˜„).
The videos can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWHTeWZGJD5ZOYv3HFsUgQG0CnPRVycbu&amp;jct=rLRp14kqRdyMaj9ax612ar_YeSt0gQ&amp;disable_polymer=true">here</a> and all the materials we
  used can be found <a href="https://github.com/asbates/bayes-time-series">here</a>.</p>
