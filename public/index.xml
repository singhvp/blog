      <description>Introduction Linear Regression is one of the most simple, intuitive, and easy to learn modeling technique which has been heavily used in predicting a quantitative response and it falls under classification of Supervised Learning. A simple search of “Linear Regression” on Google scholar returns 4+ Million result and there is so much information available online for free explaining Linear Regression in detail. Today there are many sophisticated techniques available for prediction and prescription analytic but a solid foundation in Linear Regression is must to understand nuances of modeling before you can jump and start applying more advanced techniques.</description>

      <description>Coming from Mechanical Engineering background, I always found it difficult to dabble with programming. However, lately I realized that I do enjoy statistics | data-science for which I have to use computers. So my plan is to hash out descent quality posts focusing on data-science primarily using R for anyone who is new to programming.</description>
