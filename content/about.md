Hello World! My name is Vinay Singh and welcome to my website. I come from a Mechanical and Industrial Engineering background but lately found myself "playing" with lot of manufacturing data which got me hooked into Statistics using R. My plan is to keep my thoughts and code in one place using blogs, so primarily I'm writing this for my own benefit.

I dig Metallica and I :heart: pipes.
